# <Prework-study-guide>


## This study guide helps bootcamp student to review material covered in pre-work modules.


The motivation behind the creation of this study guide was to allow bootcamp student to have a accessble website that can help review basic concepts of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Although challenging, by creating this study guide, I learned important skills in coding such problem-solving, debugging, and troubleshooting.
